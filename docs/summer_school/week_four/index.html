      <hr />
     
      <p><span class="date">[26/07/2024]</span> - The Three Ds of Data Strategy was developed following week five of attending Curruthers &amp; Jacksons Summer School for Data Leaders.  It brings together their (Caroline Carruthers, Peter Jackson and Dave Atherton) expertise and my experience to form the basis of how you may go about developing your own data strategy.</p>
<h2 id="purpose">Purpose</h2>
<p>What is the (business) purpose of the data strategy - what is the &lsquo;why&rsquo; that will drive the data strategy and transformation required to deliver it?</p>
<pre><code>A clear purpose and data strategy will deliver outcomes that are aligned with the business strategy. 
</code></pre>
<h2 id="steps-to-develop-a-data-strategy">Steps to develop a data strategy</h2>
<h3 id="step-one---discovery">Step One - Discovery</h3>
<h4 id="as-with-any-project-the-first-place-to-start-is-an-audit-here-are-some-questions-you-may-ask">As with any project, the first place to start is an Audit. Here are some questions you may ask:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Do we have an existing data strategy - when was it last reviewed?</li>
<li>Where is all the data?</li>
<li>What works well?</li>
<li>What isn&rsquo;t working so well?</li>
<li>Are we aware of any major risks?</li>
<li>What is a technology stack?</li>
<li>What are the business objectives?</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="these-questions-will-help-guide-you-in-developing-your-own-data-strategy-as-part-of-step-one-here-are-some-additional-points-to-consider">These questions will help guide you in developing your own data strategy. As part of step one, here are some additional points to consider:</h4>
<ul>
<li>Review Annual Report for business objectives - how can the data help?</li>
<li>Where is the data for current metrics?</li>
<li>Differentiate between technical data strategy and business data strategy</li>
<li>Strategy must be able to flow with business strategy.</li>
<li>Data strategy should be reviewed regularly. Internally every month or quarterly. Externally (Organisation level)- every six months to a year.</li>
<li>Your data strategy should align to business strategy</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="understanding-the-multi-dimensional-data-strategy">Understanding the Multi-Dimensional Data Strategy.</h4>
<pre><code>+ Urgent Data Strategy e.g. deliver immediate business value or address a risk.
    + High profile problems.
    + Stop things getting worse.
    + Start laying foundations


+ Immediate Data Strategy
    + Use what you have to create value
    + Break down Silos
    + Performance
    + Governance
    + Security 

+ Target Data Strategy
    + Vision
    + Principles
    + Goals
    + How to deliver your vision
    + Value 
    + How to win hearts and minds     
</code></pre>
<p>Armed with the information from discovery it&rsquo;s time to carry out a Data Maturity Assessment. I&rsquo;ll cover that in a separate blog.</p>
<h3 id="step-two---definition">Step Two - Definition</h3>
<h4 id="the-discovery-and-the-data-maturity-assessment-from-discovery-will-help-you-define-your-data-strategy-here-are-some-things-to-remember">The discovery and the Data Maturity Assessment from discovery will help you define your data strategy. Here are some things to remember:</h4>
<ul>
<li>You &lsquo;will&rsquo; have to tackle problems before you are able to define a data strategy.</li>
<li>Understand that while the steps are distinct on paper, reality is different and urgent matters may have to be dealt with before you have the opportunity to put the data strategy in place. Remember the multi-dimensional data strategy.</li>
</ul>
<h4 id="the-data-strategy">The Data Strategy</h4>
<ul>
<li>Set out the Vision.</li>
<li>Address the outcomes of the discovery and Data Maturity Assessment.</li>
<li>Focus on outcome and data, &rsquo;not&rsquo; technology.</li>
<li>Be Succinct.</li>
<li>Include Metrics where possible.</li>
<li>Articulate what good looks like.</li>
<li>Credible and sound like you.</li>
<li>A problem understood is a problem 50% solved.</li>

<ul>
<li>All projects are data projects.</li>
