      <description>Normalising financial data serves several important purposes. Here are some examples:&#xA;Comparison Across Assets: It allows you to compare the performance of different assets or financial instruments on a like-for-like basis. By expressing prices as a percentage of a base value (e.g., the starting price), you can easily see which assets have performed better over time, regardless of their original price levels.&#xA;Trend Analysis: Normalised data helps in identifying trends and patterns more clearly.</description>

      <description>I have been reading, &amp;lsquo;The Art of Statistics: Learning from Data&amp;rsquo; and came across the PPDAC framework fairly early on in the book. David Spiegelhalter, the author, is a big proponent of the framework. I have outlined it below with a view as a data leader.&#xA;What is PPDAC? Having a structured framework in statistical analysis is important to help bring order to complex statistical analysis problems. It does this by bring clarity, a step-by-step approach, consistency, effective solutions aswell as documentation and communication.</description>

      <title>The First 30-90 Days as a Data Delivery Leader</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/notes/first_30_days/</link>

      <description>I was recently asked about how I would tackle the first 30-90 days as a data leader should I get the job. This is an interesting question, and having a plan will certainly help you get started on the right foot. In my mind, it’s always been clear: start with what you have, build relationships, and identify quick wins. The role was for a Head of Delivery and Product - someone who understood and had implemented agile methodologies and recognized the importance of being product-led in the area of data.</description>

      <description>Financial crime is a huge problem and the blanket term is used to describe any crime relating to financial institutions and markets. The scale of the problem can be seen in Nasdaq&amp;rsquo;s first Financial Crime Report published in 2024[1].&#xA;The Nasdaq 2024 Global Financial Crime Report found that more than $3.1 trillion in illicit funds flowed through the global financial system last year alone. This includes nearly $800 billion in drug trafficking, nearly $350 billion in human trafficking, and more than $11 billion in terrorist financing.</description>

It can come from various sources in both structured and unstructured formats. Examples include ESG data, transaction data, web traffic, media sentiment, social media sentiment, and sensor data, among others.</description>

      <title>Understanding the LLM Context Window and Why It Matters</title>
      <link>http://localhost:1313/notes/understanding_the_llm_context_window/</link>

      <guid>http://localhost:1313/notes/understanding_the_llm_context_window/</guid>
      <description>What are context windows? A context window is simply the chat you have with an LLM (like ChatGPT). Think of it as short-term memory! It keeps track of your prompts and its outputs as you chat. So, if you start a new chat, that context will be lost.&#xA;A context window has a limit. For example, the limit in Copilot in the Edge Browser is 8,000 tokens. A token can be a word, part of a word, character, or space.</description>
