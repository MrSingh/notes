<h2 id="the-problem">The Problem</h2>
<p>My website had a static menu along the top bar and, whilst it served a purpose, it was not working on mobile. I knew it needed fixing and evolving.</p>
<h2 id="step-1---give-copilot-some-context">Step 1 - Give Copilot some context</h2>
<p>I cut and paste the current menu system into Copilot.</p>
<h2 id="step-2---the-prompt">Step 2 - The Prompt</h2>
<pre><code>I need to create a responsive dropdown menu for mobile and a side panel for desktop. Can you provide the HTML and CSS for this?
</code></pre>
<p>Copilot gave me the HTML code and CSS. I noticed an error, not by Copilot but one I had previously made. There were some height attributes hard-coded into the HTML, so I asked it to revise this and move the height styling into the CSS.</p>
<h2 id="step-3---change-class-and-id-names">Step 3 - Change class and ID names</h2>
<p>I asked it to change the class and ID names to prevent any conflicts.</p>
<h2 id="step-4---test-and-review">Step 4 - Test and review</h2>
<p>Everything worked well except I decided I wanted a side panel to hold the menu. So I prompted it to do that and asked it to select an appropriate menu icon from the Google Material library.</p>
<h2 id="step-5---mobile-styles-adjustment">Step 5 - Mobile styles adjustment</h2>
<p>The styles on mobile were not quite right. I observed what needed changing and requested those changes be made.</p>
<h2 id="step-6---merge-css">Step 6 - Merge CSS</h2>
<p>Something was still wrong. I reverted the code and realized I had tweaked the CSS to fix something. So I pasted my CSS into Copilot and asked it to merge that with the last iteration.</p>
<h2 id="step-7---test-and-review-again">Step 7 - Test and review again</h2>
<p>Looking good!</p>
<h2 id="step-8---create-reusable-code">Step 8 - Create reusable code</h2>
<p>I use Hugo for my website, so I asked it to create a menu ‘partial’, a snippet of code that can be used in a templating system.</p>
<h2 id="step-9---test-and-review-again">Step 9 - Test and review again</h2>
<p>Looking good!</p>
<h2 id="step-10---deploy">Step 10 - Deploy</h2>
