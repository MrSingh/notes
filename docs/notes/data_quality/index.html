<h2 id="what-are-data-quality-issues">What are Data Quality Issues?</h2>
<p>Data quality issues range from basic problems like duplicate data, format issues, and invalid data to more complex challenges such as data bias, ambiguous data, and unstructured data. View a more comprehensive list of data issues <a href="#table-of-data-issues">here</a>.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-better-quality-data">Steps to Better Quality Data</h2>
<p>Sometimes it’s obvious where the issue is coming from - it’s always been around, and someone knows how to fix it temporarily to get a report out in time. Sound familiar? But to start fixing things, you have to ask a number of questions. I call it discovery! Discovery is about asking questions, the foundation of your strategy to clean dirty data.</p>
<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the data quality issues?</li>
<li>What are the business impacts of these data quality issues?</li>
<li>Can you measure the impact and or risk?</li>
<li>Where are the data quality issues arising?</li>
<li>Is it at the source, before it enters your main database, data warehouse, or data lake?</li>
<li>Is it happening during the ETL process, when data is added to the database?</li>
<li>Is it a problem that is manifesting itself during the analysis phase or when it is published in the report or dashboard?</li>
<li>Most importantly, do we have a data owner that can help?</li>
</ul>
<p>Part of ‘Discovery’ is to understand the data quality issues and their impact on business. Is it easier to wrangle the data post-data entry than it is to change systems and processes that will lead to better data? Changing well-defined processes that may inconvenience a customer for better data input may have an adverse effect - especially if you can fix it relatively easily. It’s important to understand at which stage you will tackle that data issue. It’s important to frame it in the value or risk associated with it to the business - you must be able to measure the impact in some way.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“No data is clean, but most is useful.” — Dean Abbott</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Understanding the lineage of your data will greatly help. Where the data comes from, how it is transformed into new data points, what calculations are done, and how that is presented in reports or dashboards. Normally, many aspects of definition (see below) are already in place; however, more than likely, it will be incomplete. If you can&rsquo;t show the lineage of your data, how can you trust it?</p>
<p>Data Lineage is important in tracking data quility issues. There are a number of Cloud services such as Snowflake and Azure that provide a suite of tools that can help.</p>
<p>Defining data is critical in cleaning bad data but also maintaining quality data. It&rsquo;s an important part of the strategy to maintain quality data sources to help drive data-decision making to achieve positive business outcomes.</p>
<h3 id="defining-your-data">Defining Your Data</h3>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Catalogue</li>
<li>Data Structure</li>
<li>Data Lineage</li>
<li>Data Classification</li>
<li>Data Ownership</li>
</ol>
<p>Defining your data will go a long way in ensuring you can tackle data quality issues quickly and efficiently. But most importantly, identifying who owns the data is equally important. If you can’t identify an owner, can you assign one that you can work with? The problems in quality may be technical, human, governance-related, and/or due to a lack of operational systems that allow for issues to creep in.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Without clean data, or clean enough data, your data science is worthless.” — Michael Stonebraker</p>
</blockquote>
<p>To bring it all together, you need data management and operational and technological systems in place to reduce and eliminate data quality issues. The list below is a good start in what is needed to bring everything together to deliver on your data quality strategy. Data Teams, Data Owners, and Data Champions are vital as they are the glue to make things work. People are at the heart of solving problems, implementing solutions, and delivering outcomes that align with business strategy.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>
<p>Data quality issues can range from basic problems like duplication and formatting errors to complex ones such as data bias and unstructured data. Tackling these challenges requires a strategic approach that begins with data discovery—identifying and understanding where the data quality issues arise, whether at the source or during the transformation and analysis phases. The next step is defining your data through a data catalog, structure, lineage, classification, and ownership to ensure clarity and accountability. All the while, viewing through the lens of the impact it has on the business. We are not looking for perfection; we are looking for quality data to help us gain meaningful insights to deliver business outcomes.</p>
<p>Having a clear strategy and systems in place will help address the problems that arise. Discovery, definition, and management will form the basis of a data strategy that resolves data quality issues and provides the foundation for building data products that deliver valuable insights.</p>
