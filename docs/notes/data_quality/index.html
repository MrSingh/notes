<p>According to <a href="https://www.experian.com/blogs/news/2021/02/25/highlights-2021-global-data-management-research" target="_blank">Experian&rsquo;s 2021 Global Data Management Research</a>, &lsquo;Fifty-five percent of business leaders say they lack trust in their data assets, hindering their ability to be fully data driven.&rsquo;</p>

<h2 id="what-are-data-quality-issues">What are data quality issues?</h2>
<p>Data quality issues range from basic things like duplicate data, format issues and invalid data to more complex data issues such as data bias, ambigious data and unstructured data.  You can see the full list in the resources below.</p>
<h2 id="steps-to-better-quality-data">Steps to better quality data</h2>
<p>Sometimes it&rsquo;s obvious where the the issue is from, it&rsquo;s always been around and someone knows how to fix it temporaly to get a report out in time.  Sound familiar!?  But to start fixing things you have to ask a number of questions. Discob</p>
<h3 id="discovery">Discovery</h3>
<ul>
<li>What are the data quality issues?</li>
<li>Where are the data quality issues arising?</li>
<li>Is it at source, before it enters your main database, datawarehouse or Datelake?</li>
<li>Is it happening during the ETL process, when data is added to the database?</li>
<li>Is it a problem that is manifesting itself during the anaysis phase and or when it is publised in the report or dashboard.</li>
<li>Most importanty, do we have a data owner that can help?</li>
</ul>
<p>Understanding the linaege of your data will help to fix these problems. Where the data comes from, how it is transformed to new data points. What calculations are are done and how that is presented in reports or dashboards. Normally many aspects of definition(see below) are already in place however more then likely it will be incomplete.</p>
<p>If you can&rsquo;t show the linage of the data then how can you trust the data?</p>
<h3 id="defining-your-data">Defining your data</h3>
<p>This includes:</p>
<ol>
<li>Data Catalogue</li>
<li>Data Structure</li>
<li>Data Lineage</li>
<li>Data Classification</li>
<li>Data Ownership</li>
</ol>
<p>Defining your data will go a long way to making sure you you can tackle data quality issues quickly and efficiently. But most importantly, identifying who owns that data can go along way to solving problems quickly.  If you can&rsquo;t identify an owner can you assign an owner that you can work with? The problems in quality may be technical, human, governance and lack of operational systems that allow for problesm to creep in.</p>
