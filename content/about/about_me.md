After building my first website back in 2000, I knew I would spend the rest of my career in data and technology!

Fast forward two decades, and my passion for building data and technology solutions remains undiminished. However, I have now moved on to bigger challenges such as building teams, leading agile transformations, managing platform migrations, establishing support models, formulating data strategies, implementing data governance, managing risk, coaching agile teams, and managing teams, to name but a few.

I am particularly interested in data-driven decision-making and building systems where data propels businesses forward. I am motivated to meet business challenges and work with people to deliver on business strategy and vision.

As a lifelong learner, I share some of what I learn here.
