Back when I left university,  I already knew I was heading for a career in technology. After building my first website back in 2000 and getting instant gratification and praise - I was hooked!

Fast forward two decades, and my passion to build things and technology, is undiminished. Albeit, now I have moved on to bigger challenges such as building teams, platform migration, PCI, database architecture, process implementation, agile coaching and team management.

I am particularly interested in data driven decision making, and how to build systems where data helps drive businesses forward. Recently I have become interested in Blockchain and how it can be implemeneted in future technologies.

I do the work because I love technology. I like the people I meet and working with them to solve the challenges at hand.  

I'm a life long learner and will share some of what I learn, here.
