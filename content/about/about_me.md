A long, long, time ago, back when I left university,  I already knew I was heading for a career in technology. After building my first website back in 2000 and getting instant gratification and praise - I was hooked!

Fast forward two decades, and my passion to build things and technology, is undiminished. Albeit, now I have moved on to bigger challenges such as building teams, agile transformations, platform migrations, support models, strategy, data governance, risk management, agile coaching and team management to name but a few.

I am particularly interested in data driven decision making, and how to build systems where data helps drive businesses forward.

I do the work because I love technology. I like the people I meet and working with them to solve the challenges at hand.  

I'm a life long learner and share some of what I learn, here.
