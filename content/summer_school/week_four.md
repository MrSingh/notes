<span class="date">[26/07/2024]</span> - The Three Ds of Data Strategy was developed following week five of attending Curruthers & Jacksons Summer School for Data Leaders.  It brings together their (Caroline Carruthers, Peter Jackson and Dave Atherton) expertise and my experience to form the basis of how you may go about developing your own data strategy. 

 

## Purpose 

 

What is the (business) purpose of the data strategy - what is the 'why' that will drive the data strategy and transformation required to deliver it?  

 

    A clear purpose and data strategy will deliver outcomes that are aligned with the business strategy. 

 

## Steps to develop a data strategy 

 

### Step One - Discovery 

 

#### As with any project, the first place to start is an Audit. Here are some questions you may ask: 

 

+ Do we have an existing data strategy - when was it last reviewed? 
+ Where is all the data? 
+ What works well? 
+ What isn't working so well? 
+ Are we aware of any major risks? 
+ What is a technology stack? 
+ What are the business objectives?  

#### These questions will help guide you in developing your own data strategy. As part of step one, here are some additional points to consider: 

+ Review Annual Report for business objectives - how can the data help?
+ Where is the data for current metrics?
+ Differentiate between technical data strategy and business data strategy
+ Strategy must be able to flow with business strategy.
+ Data strategy should be reviewed regularly. Internally every month or quarterly. Externally (Organisation level)- every six months to a year.
+ Your data strategy should align to business strategy 

#### Understanding the Multi-Dimensional Data Strategy. 
 

    + Urgent Data Strategy e.g. deliver immediate business value or address a risk.
        + High profile problems.
        + Stop things getting worse.
        + Start laying foundations
 

    + Immediate Data Strategy
        + Use what you have to create value
        + Break down Silos
        + Performance
        + Governance
        + Security 

    + Target Data Strategy
        + Vision
        + Principles
        + Goals
        + How to deliver your vision
        + Value 
        + How to win hearts and minds     

 Armed with the information from discovery it's time to carry out a Data Maturity Assessment. I'll cover that in a separate blog. 

### Step Two - Definition 

#### The discovery and the Data Maturity Assessment from discovery will help you define your data strategy. Here are some things to remember:  

+ You 'will' have to tackle problems before you are able to define a data strategy.
+ Understand that while the steps are distinct on paper, reality is different and urgent matters may have to be dealt with before you have the opportunity to put the data strategy in place. Remember the multi-dimensional data strategy.  

#### The Data Strategy  

+ Set out the Vision.
+ Address the outcomes of the discovery and Data Maturity Assessment.
+ Focus on outcome and data, 'not' technology.
+ Be Succinct.
+ Include Metrics where possible.
+ Articulate what good looks like.
+ Credible and sound like you.
+ A problem understood is a problem 50% solved. 

### Step Three - Delivery 

This is a very big topic, but the points laid out below will be relevant to  most business scenarios.
 

#### Develop your Roadmap 

Understand the business and develop the roadmap that aligns to the strategy, vision and business objectives.
 
#### Challenges

You have conducted 'Discovery' and have Defined your Data Strategy. Here are the some of the challenges you will face: 

+ Supply Chain
+ Finance
+ Vendors
+ Sales Teams
+ Sirens of Cloud or AI 

#### You may have already become aware of a number of things in the discovery step but problems will arise as you go. Remember: 

+ All projects are data projects.
+ Think about outputs, not inputs.
+ Remember the purpose, what are you trying to do with the data?
    + What is the benefit?
    + What is the outcome?
    + is it aligned with business strategy? 

#### Speak their language! Depending on who you speak to you will have to adjust accordingly. 

+ Senior Management - Vision and key objectives
+ Stakeholders within the business - nontechnical but detailed enough to be clear on business outcomes and objectives.
+ Technical teams - be as specific as possible. 

#### Reports, Metrics and Risk 

+ Reports to help you highlight the achievements of you and your team.
+ Metrics to reinforse up your strategy.
+ Risks to identify when things come up and you need to course correct. 

#### Your Crew  

+ Small team of experts
+ Understand the business
+ Take ownership
+ High Trust
+ Protect your team
+ Time to do deep work
+ Distraction free
+ No blame culture 

#### Vendors 

Inevitably you will need to speak to vendors to help deliver on your strategy. This may be expertise(contractors) or a solution.  Here are some of the things to consider:  

+ Define the project clearly
+ Provide supporting documentation
+ Highlight the business goals
+ Specify requirements
+ Create a well-defined RFP 

#### Costs  

Understand your costs and budget accordingly.  

+ Cloud Comparison Tools
+ Optimisation
+ Cloud vs Data Centre's
