<span class="date">[26/07/2024]</span> - The Three Ds of Data Startegy was developed following week five of attending Curruthers & Jacksons Summer School for Data Leaders.  It brings togther their(Caroline Carruthers, Peter Jackson and Dave Atherton) expertise and my experince to form the basis of how you may go about develping your own data startegy.

## Purpose

What is the (business) purpose of the data strategy - what is the 'why' that will drive the data startegy and transformation required to deliver it? 

    A clear purpose and data strategy will deliver outcomes that are aligned with the business strategy.

## Steps to develop a data strategy

### Step One - Discovery

#### As with any project, the first place to start is an Audit. Here are some questions you may ask:

+ Do we have an existing data strategy - when was it last reviewed?
+ Where is all the data?
+ What works well?
+ What isn't working so well?
+ Are we aware of any major risks?
+ What is a technology stack?
+ What are the business objectives?

#### These questions will help guide you in developing your own data strategy. As part of step one, here are some additional points to consider:

+ Review Annual Report for business objectives - how can the data help?
+ Where is the data for current metrics?
+ Defrientiate between technical data strategy and business data strategy
+ Strategy must be able to flew with business strategy
+ Data strategy should be reveiewed regurarly. Internally every month or quarterly. Externally (Organisation level)- every six months to a year.
+ Your data startagey should align to business startegy

#### Undertanding the Multi-Dimensional Data Strategy.

    + Urgent Data Strategy e.g. deliver immediate business value or address a risk.
        + High profine prolems
        + Stop things getting worse
        + Start laying foundations

    + Immediate Data Startegy
        + Use what you have to cerate value
        + Break down Silos
        + Performance
        + Governance
        + Security

    + Target Data Strategy
        + Vision
        + Principles
        + Goals
        + How to deliver your vision
        + Value
        + How to win hearts and minds
    
 Armed with the information from discovery it's time to carry out a Data Maturity Assessement. I'll cover that in a seperate blog.

### Step Two - Definition

The discovery and the Data Marurity Assesment from discovery will help you define your data staretgy. Here are are some things to remember:

+ You 'will' have to tackle problems before you are able to define a data startegy.
+ Understand that while the steps are distinct on paper, reality is different and urgent matters may have to be dealt with before you have the opportunity to put the data startegy in place. Remember the multi dimencial data startegy.


The Data Startegy

+ Set out the Vision.
+ Address the outcomes of the discovery and Data Maturity Assement.
+ Focus on outcome and data, 'not' technology.
+ Be Succinct
+ Include Metrics where possible
+ Articulate what good looks like
+ Credible and sound like you.
+ A problem understood is a problem 50% solved.


### Step Three - Delivery

This is a very big topic but the points layed out below will be relevent to 

Develop your Roadmap

+ Understand the business and develop the roadmap that aligns to the strategy, vision and business objectives.

You have conducted 'Discovery' and have Defined your Data Startegy. Here are the some of the challenges you will face:

+ Supply Chain
+ Finance
+ Vendors
+ Sales Teams
+ Sirens of Cloud or AI

You may have already become aware of a number of things in the discovery step but problmes will arise as you go. Remember:

+ All projects are data projects.
+ Think about outputs, not inputs.
+ Remember the purpose, what are you trying to do with the data?
    + What is the benefit?
    + What is the outcome?
    + is it aligned with business strategy?

Speak their language! Depending on who you speak to you will have to adjust accoundingly.

+ Senior Management - Vision and key objectives
+ Stakeholders within the business - non technical but detailed enough to be clear on business outcomes and objectives.
+ Technical teams - be as specif as possible.

Reports, Metrics and Risk

+ Reports to help you highlight the achivements of you and your team.
+ Metrics to back it up your startegy, outcome and 
+ Risks to identify when things come up and you need to course correct.

Your Crew

+ Small team of experts
+ Understand the business
+ Take ownership
+ High Trust
+ Protect your team
+ Time to do deep work
+ Distration free
+ No blame culture

Vendors

Ineviatbly you will need to speak to vendors to help deliver on your strategy. This may be expertise(contractors) or a solution.  Here are some of the things to consider:

+ Define the project clearly
+ Provide supporting documenation
+ Highlight the business goals
+ Specify requirements
+ Create a well defined RFP

Costs

Understand your costs and buget accordingly.

+ Cloud Comparison Tools
+ Optimisation
+ Cloud vs Data Centre's
