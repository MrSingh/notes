## What is a Data Leader?

Is the most senior individual in an organisation that is responsible for data.

Peter Jackson started as a Business Analyst, then became a Full-Stack Engineer before moving into digital strategy as head of data and then CDO.

## Different Types of CDO

- 1st Generation - Lays the foundation or groundwork
- 2nd Generation - Reimagining of the role based on business value
- 3rd Generation - It's a business role that uses technology

This is to help you have that conversation to see where you fit in with the organisation and to understand the organisations data journey up until now.
