## Log

 ### <span class="date">05/07/2024</span>
 
 This project is being reserectted but pivoting it in the direction of an ESG Database. Originally the focus was reporting and whist reporting will play a part the focus will be the database and it's architecture.  More deatils to follow.

## Summary

This project was started as a side of the desk project in late 2020 to build a system that would automatically download S&P 500 annual reports and extract ESG data for the purpose of collecting data and providing a report on the state of ESG reporting for the S&P 500.  This was designed to give me exposre to real world problems that I would try and solve with Python.  With ESG data being increasing important I was interested to see how I could make a difference. The project stalled when I started working at Showbrook Bank in 2021.

## Project Details

1. Stage One: Successfully completed the task of building a database of sites for the S&P 500, including website links.
2. Stage Two: Developed a Python program to query the list and download annual reports for each company. While progress was made, further work is needed. Although more automation and data extraction are possible, I began questioning its overall value.
3. Stage Three: Originally invisaged as the extraction of ESG data. The focus will now turn to 'any' ESG data, it's storage and relavance to regulatory requirements, sources, analysis, and addressing missing information within the regulatory and governance context.
