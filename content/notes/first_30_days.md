I was recently asked about how I would tackle the first 30-90 days as a data leader should I get the job. This is an interesting question, and having a plan will certainly help you get started on the right foot. In my mind, it’s always been clear: start with what you have, build relationships, and identify quick wins. The role was for a Head of Delivery and Product - someone who understood and had implemented agile methodologies and recognized the importance of being product-led in the area of data. So, let’s break it down in relation to that particular role. Think of it as an outline of the things you should cover.

## The First 30 Days - Audit/Review Phase
### Build Relationships

+ **Team:** Understand their roles, strengths, and challenges. Get to know the team and set initial expectations
+ **Stakeholders:** Introduce yourself to stakeholders and understand their expectations, requirements, current challenges, and pain points

### Review & Audit

+ Understand where we are with our current projects, roadmap, and BAU (Business as Usual)
+ Review the current state of infrastructure and policies
+ Review the budget

### Quick Wins

+ Identify and implement quick wins
+ Identify high risks


## The First 60 Days - Transformation Phase
### Strategic Planning
+ Implement ‘Agile and Product-Led Delivery’.
+ Implement the roadmap.

### Operational Optimisation

+ Assess and refine existing processes in a product-led delivery format.
### Team Development

+ Review current career development plans and foster a culture of continuous development and collaboration.
### Resource Allocation

+ Ongoing review of budget and resource allocation
+ Pitch for additional funding based on requirements
## The First 90 Days - Delivery Phase
### Delivery

+ Product-led projects
+ Quality management
+ Governance
### Stakeholder Communication

+ Regular updates identifying progress, milestones, challenges, and successes.
+ Long-term Vision
+ Longer-term strategic objectives aligned with business objectives.

## Conclusion
In reality, it’s highly likely that many of these things will merge into one another, but having clear milestones for yourself and your team will make it easier to communicate with senior management about your vision and how you will go about addressing the challenges ahead. Whilst this is just an outline, it’s important to understand what you have before starting to make wholesale changes. Lean on the strength of what is already in place and set a course to deliver business value based on a strategic vision. Work with others to develop the strategic direction whilst developing a culture of ownership and delivery. Fail fast and course correct as necessary - be agile!
