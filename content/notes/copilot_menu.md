## The Problem

My website had a static menu along the top bar and, whilst it served a purpose, it was not working on mobile. I knew it needed fixing and evolving.

## Step 1 - Give Copilot some context

I cut and paste the current menu system into Copilot.

## Step 2 - The Prompt

    I need to create a responsive dropdown menu for mobile and a side panel for desktop. Can you provide the HTML and CSS for this?

Copilot gave me the HTML code and CSS. I noticed an error, not by Copilot but one I had previously made. There were some height attributes hard-coded into the HTML, so I asked it to revise this and move the height styling into the CSS.

## Step 3 - Change class and ID names

I asked it to change the class and ID names to prevent any conflicts.

## Step 4 - Test and review

Everything worked well except I decided I wanted a side panel to hold the menu. So I prompted it to do that and asked it to select an appropriate menu icon from the Google Material library.

## Step 5 - Mobile styles adjustment

The styles on mobile were not quite right. I observed what needed changing and requested those changes be made.

## Step 6 - Merge CSS

Something was still wrong. I reverted the code and realized I had tweaked the CSS to fix something. So I pasted my CSS into Copilot and asked it to merge that with the last iteration.

## Step 7 - Test and review again

Looking good!

## Step 8 - Create reusable code

I use Hugo for my website, so I asked it to create a menu ‘partial’, a snippet of code that can be used in a templating system.

## Step 9 - Test and review again

Looking good!

## Step 10 - Deploy

What’s important here is I was able to do this in half a day. If I had to do this from scratch, it would have taken 3-5 days, possibly longer! The other important thing here is the Pilot - me, guiding this process. I have the environment to test, develop, and deploy, and most importantly, the technical background and know-how to facilitate this fast development.

This process allowed me to quickly and efficiently update my website’s menu system, ensuring it works seamlessly across all devices.
