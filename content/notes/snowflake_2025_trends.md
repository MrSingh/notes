Snowflake has just released its 2025 Data Trends Report for Financial services.  

Here's a quick summary: 

‚û°Ô∏è Foundational Data Infrastructure is a non-negotiable.  

‚û°Ô∏è ROI is becoming increasingly important - what value are we deriving from Data and AI?  

Lorraine Knerr, Global Head of Generative AI and Data Solutions, Architecture and Strategy at AWS, agrees. "Coming into this year, we're seeing a much more measured approach with customers in terms of validating their data foundations are in place. Really pushing on what is the business value, the ROI of these solutions, and are they driving improved customer journeys and generating expected revenue in the initial flurry of leveraging gen AI?"  

‚û°Ô∏è Increased AI Regulation ‚Äì primarily from the European Union Artificial Intelligence Act and the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's prioritising AI governance as part of its examination priorities.

‚û°Ô∏è Tapping into the potential of unstructured data to unlock efficiencies and productivity.  

‚û°Ô∏è Data Sharing and Alternative Data - tapping into data from the likes of ServiceNow, Jira, Salesforce, and other third-party data suppliers, to facilitate additional insights and gain a competitive advantage.  

‚û°Ô∏è In-house AI applications - may not have fancy names or marketing, but these will drive significant change and ultimately have the most impact on ROI.  

Ultimately, nothing new here, but the focus has shifted from 'let's use Gen AI' to 'how can we use Gen AI to increase productivity, efficiency and ROI'.
