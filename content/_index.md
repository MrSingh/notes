After building my first website back in 2000, I was hooked.

Fast forward two decades, and my passion for building data and technology solutions remains undiminished. Over the years  the challenges have grown significantly. From building teams, leading agile transformations, managing platform migrations, establishing support models, formulating data strategies, implementing data governance, managing risk, coaching agile teams, and managing teams, to name but a few. Problem solving is at the heart of data and technology and I enjoy working with a diverse set of people to deliver.


Now the focus is primarily on data, its underlying technology, and the governance surrounding it and implementing data-driven decision-making strategies and sytems that empower businesses to grow. My motivation lies in meeting business challenges and collaborating with others to execute business strategies and achieve our vision.

Away from work, I like to be outside and it's probably why I enjoy running. Having completed a number of half marathons, I am now training for my first marathon

As a lifelong learner, I share some of what I learn here.
